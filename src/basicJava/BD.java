//Interface --> 
//how define one interface 
//implement the  interface on the class 
//because same package we create class we main method and create obj

//Interface - A   , Interface B with abstract methods 
//Implement both interface on class with definition 
//We create main method on another and create obj and called methods

//An interface is fully abstract class . 
//To implement it on class we need to user "implement" keyword
//we need to method abstract method over the class
//We can then create object of class
